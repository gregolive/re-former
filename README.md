# Rails Forms Practice

Project made to practice building form in Rails. First the form was built using HTML, then with Rails' soft-deprecated #form_tag, and finally with #form_with. Building out the forms in the different ways was useful to see what goes on behind the scenes when using #form_with and demonstarted the ease of use that comes with #form_with.
